# ecosystem

This is a computer graphics university project I did. it is an implementation of an echosystem.

The idea for the project came from this youtube video:

The way it works is there are two types of animals in this echosystem:

A wolf:

And a sheep:

The wolf eats the sheep and the sheep eats this red plant:

The first screen is the main menu, where the user can choose to start the simulation, go to settings or quit:

In the setting menu, the user can choose the number of wolves and sheep that will appear at the start of the simmulation:

after the simulation is starting, the wolves and sheep will wonder around the scene looking for food:

The user can move the camera around the scene using the keyboard arrows and the mouse scroller. 

Each animal (wolf and sheep) has the next traits:
* Gender - can be a male or a female
* Speed - deternmines the speed of the movement of the animal around the scene
* Mating Desire - 
* Likeliness To GetSick -
* Longevity - 
* Attractivnes - 
* Amune System Probs -
